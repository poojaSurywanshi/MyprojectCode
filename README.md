E-commerce Automation 
This project is a Test Automation Framework built using Selenium WebDriver, Java, Cucumber (BDD), and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
It is designed to provide a scalable, maintainable, and readable structure for automating functional and regression testing of web applications.
==Key Features==
-Page Object Model (POM): Improves code reusability and maintainability by separating page locators and actions.
-Cucumber (BDD): Enables writing test cases in Gherkin language, making them easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Selenium WebDriver: Provides robust browser automation across multiple browsers.
-Data-Driven Testing: Supports parameterization using Cucumber Examples and DataTables.
-Hooks & Tags: Implements @Before and @After hooks for setup/teardown, and tags for selective test execution.
-Maven Integration: Handles dependencies, build, and test execution efficiently.
-Reporting: Generates detailed execution reports (Allure / Extent Reports) for better visibility of test results.
-Cross-Browser Testing: Can be extended to run tests on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.
