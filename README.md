Page Object Model ensures clean separation of test logic and UI elements for maintainability.
Integrated with Maven for build and dependency management.
Supports cross-browser testing, data-driven scenarios, and tagging for selective execution.
Generates detailed execution reports (Allure/Extent) for clear visibility of test results.
